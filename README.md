Do you need a set of sensors to collect data for your project? You may already have it on your Android device!

_Sense-it_ gives access to all the sensors on your smartphone or tablet devices.
If you are curious about the sensors your device may have and what you might do with them,
use this app to record data and generate graphs from your sensors, or check the type and hardware model of your sensors.
